In Dart, asynchronous programming is achieved through the use of the async and await keywords, along with Future and Stream objects. These features allow you to write non-blocking code that can perform tasks concurrently, such as fetching data from a network or reading from a file, without blocking the execution of your program.

Here's an overview of how asynchronous programming works in Dart:

Future: A Future represents a potential value or error that will be available at some point in the future. You can think of a Future as a placeholder for a value that hasn't been computed yet. You can create a Future using the Future class constructor, or by using asynchronous functions marked with the async keyword.

async and await: The async keyword is used to mark a function as asynchronous, which means that it can perform operations asynchronously and return a Future. Inside an asynchronous function, you can use the await keyword to wait for the result of another Future without blocking the execution of the function.

Completing a Future: You can complete a Future manually by creating an instance of the Completer class and calling its complete() method with the desired value. This is useful when you need to work with APIs that are not asynchronous by default.

Stream: A Stream represents a sequence of asynchronous events. You can listen to a Stream to receive events as they occur, and handle them asynchronously using the await for loop or the listen() method.
